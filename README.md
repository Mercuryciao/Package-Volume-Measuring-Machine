# Package Volume Measuring Machine

## Overview
The Package Volume Measuring Machine is a Python-based project designed for measuring the volume of packages using infrared ranging, camera, and OpenCV on Raspberry Pi. 

## Features
- **Infrared Ranging**: Utilizes infrared sensors to measure distances, crucial for accurate volume calculations.
- **Camera Integration**: Captures images of packages for analysis using a connected camera.
- **Image Processing**: Leverages OpenCV for image manipulation, enabling precise measurement and dimension extraction.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Designed to run on Raspberry Pi, ensuring flexibility and cost-effectiveness for deployment.

## Installation
To set up the Package Volume Measuring Machine on your Raspberry Pi:
1. **Clone the repository**:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Package-Volume-Measuring-Machine.git
cd Package-Volume-Measuring-Machine
```

2. **Run the application**:
This will start the package volume measuring process using the configured sensors and camera.
```
python3 image_processing.py
```
